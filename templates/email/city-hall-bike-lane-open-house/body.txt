On Wednesday, OTIS is hosting a **public open house for the City Hall bike lane project.** This is an opportunity to learn more about the project, see the proposed design, meet the project team, and **fill out an exit survey**.

This project is going in as a *pilot* because Councilmember Young has [withheld his support](https://billypenn.com/2025/10/01/councilman-jeffery-young-hold-bike-lane/). **We need folks to leave positive feedback on the public exit survey** to prove that the public supports the project. On the exit survey, rate the project 5 stars and put any critiques in the written comments.
