**Complete the Fishtown Neighbors Association (FNA) Bikeways Final Design [Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeL81B0afqADkLoHdLLU9QraZZy9zkU2pjHTdGZ6m4scQCeeA/viewform) by September 24 to ensure protected bike infrastructure.**

OTIS is finalizing their designs for the **[Fishtown Neighborhood Bikeways Project](https://www.phila.gov/documents/fishtown-bikeways/)**, which aims to make residential streets safer for people walking and biking. **FNA opened a survey to gather YOUR input on two locations, one eastbound and one westbound,** to determine which designs should move forward to final design. **You must live within the FNA boundaries to vote.**

<b><u>Section 1. Eastbound: Palmer St - Frankford Ave to Sepviva St</u></b>

**PBA recommends: Eastbound Route A. Parking Protected Contraflow Lane** 

This is the **only option that includes *necessary* protection for the contraflow lanes**. The **buffered option includes zero protection from oncoming traffic**, where vehicles frequently speed and make quick left turns on to Frankford Ave.

<b><u>Section 2. Westbound: Delaware Avenue & Palmer Park</u></b>

**PBA recommends: Westbound Route B.** Answer “**No**” to “Do you support moving forward with Westbound Route A as part of near-term implementation with the Neighborhood Bikeways project?”

We recommend “No” because it provides the **opportunity for a high quality bike lane on Delaware Ave** that **connects more directly to Palmer St**. The longer-term solution on Delaware Ave would also likely connect further north to the bike path at Aramingo Avenue under I-95. This would then link to the bike lanes on York St. into Fishtown. 

The proposed **Westbound Route A** is not a high quality bike lane and **would put bikers and pedestrians in conflict on a narrow, shared sidewalk path**. It is also **unclear if the proposed contraflow lane on Columbia would be protected**.

In the open comment box, we recommend explicitly stating that you want a two way, concrete protected bike lane on Delaware Ave that connects to Aramingo Avenue.
