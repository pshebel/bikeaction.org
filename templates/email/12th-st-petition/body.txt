Last call for the 12th Street Complete Street Petition\! **12th Street** is being repaved from Spring Garden to Vine Street this year. Tell the Streets Department you support a “Complete Street” design on 12th Street\!

The proposed improvements would:

* **Slow down traffic** on 12th Street, increasing safety for people walking, biking, and driving  
* **Reduce crossing distances** for people walking and in wheelchairs  
* **Make it safer for families** to access community amenities like the Rail Park  
* **Provide a buffer** from noisy car traffic for people on sidewalks  
* Serve as an important extension of the 12th Street **bike lane**  
* **Decrease congestion** at the 12th and Callowhill Street intersections

You can [sign the petition and view the proposed design](https://bikeaction.org/campaigns/safer-12th-st/) on the PBA website. The petition will close on November 8, so be sure to sign before then\!
